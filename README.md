Data Mining Twitter

I'm learning to use and interact with the Twitter API, with the book Intro to Python for CS and Data Science (Paul Deitel, Harvey Deitel).

■ Understand Twitter’s impact
on businesses, brands,
reputation, sentiment
analysis, predictions and
more.

■ Use Tweepy, one of the most
popular Python Twitter API
clients for data mining Twitter.

■ Use the Twitter Search API to
download past tweets that
meet your criteria.

■ Use the Twitter Streaming API
to sample the stream of live
tweets as they’re happening.

■ See that the tweet objects
returned by Twitter contain
valuable information beyond
the tweet text.

■ Use the natural language
processing techniques to
clean and preprocess tweets to
prepare them for analysis.

■ Perform sentiment analysis on
tweets.

■ Spot trends with Twitter’s
Trends API.

■ Map tweets using folium and
OpenStreetMap.
